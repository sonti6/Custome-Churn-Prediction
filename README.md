# Custome-Churn-Prediction
Product Requirement Document (PRD)

1. Introduction

This predictive system identifies customers at risk of churn using advanced machine learning techniques. It aims to support proactive retention strategies, enhancing customer lifetime value and optimising marketing efforts through data-driven insights.

2. Core Goals

Reduce Churn: Target a 5–10% reduction within the first six months through predictive modelling.
Enhance Customer Value: Leverage data to identify retention opportunities, increasing customer lifetime value.
Optimise Retention Budget: Allocate resources efficiently using churn probability scores.
Improve Satisfaction: Preempt customer issues with predictive alerts.
3. Data Architecture & Sources

Data Ingestion: Integrate data from CRM, billing systems, service logs via APIs and ETL pipelines.
Data Storage: Utilise relational (SQL) and non-relational (NoSQL) databases for flexible data management.
Data Processing: Employ batch and real-time processing architectures using Python and cloud-based services.
4. Prediction Engine

Model Development: Implement supervised learning algorithms (e.g., logistic regression, random forests, gradient boosting) for churn prediction.
Feature Engineering: Derive predictive features from usage patterns, transaction histories, and customer demographics.
Model Evaluation: Use metrics like Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC-AUC for performance assessment.
Model Deployment: Containerise models using Docker; deploy via RESTful APIs for scalability.
Model Monitoring: Continuous model performance tracking with automated retraining triggers.
5. Reporting & Visualisation

Dashboards: Develop interactive dashboards using tools like Power BI or Tableau.
Churn Drivers: Visualise feature importance and key churn contributors.
Segmentation: Automate customer risk grouping for targeted interventions.
6. Technical Requirements

Programming Languages: Python (pandas, scikit-learn, TensorFlow), SQL for queries.
Cloud Platforms: AWS/GCP/Azure for model hosting and data storage.
APIs: RESTful APIs for system integrations.
Data Privacy: Ensure GDPR and CCPA compliance in data handling.
Scalability: Design for handling increasing data volumes with distributed processing frameworks like Spark.
7. Success Metrics

Model Accuracy: Achieve ROC-AUC ≥ 0.80.
Churn Reduction: Minimum 5% decrease post-system deployment.
System Uptime: Ensure 99.9% uptime for predictive services. Team Adoption: High usage rates among marketing and customer success teams driven by actionable insights.
